English nerd -> [Seawolf](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) -> software engineer @ Viacom.  Currently working as a javascript developer developing awesome kid-friendly experiences on the web for Nickelodeon and NickJr.

- after the period (fight me, [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/OneSpaceorTwo.html))
- as the perfect tab length

you can find me at various tech [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/members/96241402/) around NYC which all started with that one summer I [interned there](http://making.meetup.com/post/58931840916/introducing-meetupquest), starting many unfinished sewing projects around my house (oops), going on local dog-friendly adventures with my [corgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardigan_Welsh_Corgi) Meryl, or using my nieces for usability testing.
