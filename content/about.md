English nerd -> [Seawolf](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) -> software engineer @ Viacom.  Currently working as a javascript developer making awesome kid-friendly experiences on the web for Nickelodeon and NickJr.  


Corg-mom to a [cardigan welsh corgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardigan_Welsh_Corgi) named Meryl although [this guy](https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/614417373316153344) is much better at this whole rocking the "Corgi parent" thing.

you can find me at various tech [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/members/96241402/) around NYC which all started with that one summer I [interned there](http://making.meetup.com/post/58931840916/introducing-meetupquest), starting many unfinished sewing projects around my house (oops), going on local dog-friendly adventures, using my nieces for usability testing, or writing ridiculous run-on sentences (I also have been told I talk very fast by other New Yorkers, so at the very least it reads very true to life).  


You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwZCfk49XK_MS3NHTk1vNXdvaU0/view?usp=sharing) and that talk I did one time on decorators in Python [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TmaaYFMZYYugkYFG3U2Tw_Ro0V033D_cGE_Tz2z21Jc/edit?usp=sharing)
