For the next 7 days, Ryan and I are making our own version of the Oregon trail (from New York to Seattle), along with the dog and everything we own in one of these![](/img/covered_wagon.jpg "All of the fording the river jokes have been made").  

Peak levels of 'Murica have been reached, folks.

I have a history of making excuses based on overplayed stereotypes of salt-of-the-earth folk and cultural incest in an effort to avoid the awkward conversation about my policy of never moving to anywhere where I might be the most "ethnic" looking person in the zip code.  It's so easy to write off entire swaths of the country this way.  

That being said, in an effort to enjoy the 48+ hours of driving and weeklong stay in the heart of the nation I'm going to put aside my cultural identity crisis for the time being and learn as much as I can about each of the cities and towns that we are staying in along the way.

### Day 0 - Columbus, OH

Prior to this trip, all I knew about Ohio was that: 

- My dad briefly went to college there
- They have two football teams  
and 
- People there love this spaghetti dish called [Skyline Chili](/img/skyline.jpg)

I didn't have a ton of time to do research.  We got to the hotel at 4am, across the street from the county court so not exactly a picturesque historic downtown sort of area.  
On the entrance of the hotel we were staying at, I noticed a plaque next to the entrance that said:  

> "National Register of Historic Places: The Great Southern Hotel"

The National Historic Register documentation [has not been digitized at this time](http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/82001458) but from what I could gather from my limited resources: 

- The hotel opened in 1896 or 1897 (the hotel's website and wikipedia differ on this).  
- Prior to its opening, a series of fires destroyed some of the most prominent hotels in Columbus.  The Great Southern Hotel & Theater was an undertaking to replace the city gathering spaces and cultural centers that were lost.
- The building was designed to be "fireproof", was also one of the first in the city to both use and produce electricity.
- The theater was reopened in 1998, after a $10MM renovation.

I wish we had gotten to stay a bit longer and explore the hotel and the surrounding city.  Meryl and I took an early morning walk in the surrounding area, but we didn't find too much besides the [Columbus Commons](http://columbuscommons.org/) and some under construction high-rise apartments.  

I feel like we missed out on Ohio having only spent about 5-6 hours in Columbus and not in a very exciting neighborhood at that, so any suggestions on places to see or things to do the next time we hit the state would be greatly appreciated.
