In the spring of 2013, I applied for an internship with Meetup while about 90% convinced I wouldn't get a yes because I had no internet presence, no side projects, no evidence that I had any experience outside of interning at banks.  

Not only did I get a call back, but I made it through about 7 different interviews.  Each of those interviews were more conversation, less gauntlet, and so when all was said and done I was 100% convinced that this was a place I needed to experience firsthand.

I turned down what would have been at the time my highest paid offer to date to intern at JP Morgan to join Meetup as a UI developer intern.  It is a decision that I would make again in a heartbeat.  

On our first week on the job, the new hires had lunch with Scott and I had no idea what to expect.  The first thing he asked us was "why do you think you were hired?  What do you think we saw in you?" and I was 100% unprepared to answer that question.  Previously, every job I had ever gotten was basically by virtue of not sucking at the soft stuff in interview -- smile, answer questions intelligently and politely, firm handshake, smile, make eye contact, and don't do anything weird and above all do not smell.  Here I was, 1 of 2 interns chosen out of hundreds of applicants, and the best answer I could muster:

"Erm, because I did well on a coding challenge and knew some javascript fundamentals?"

"No, you are not here because you passed a fucking coding interview" was the response I got, and to be honest completely deserved.  He went on to explain the qualities they were looking in people and how important those things were to the culture of Meetup.

Meetup is mission driven like most other companies in the world, but it is the first place I have worked where that mission is quantified in real impact on real people: number of engagements between members who met through Meetup, number of new friendships between people who lived in the same building for years, number of people who learned to code because they saw a meetup happening near them, number of people who accidentally stumbled onto a nude life drawing class, and so forth.
