I'm not sure when this all began, but right now it is July 10th and about halfway through what I consider real summer and I have been plagued by this near-constant sense that I should be doing something.  It's not like I don't keep myself busy, but lately I feel like none of those things require any kind of boundary pushing.  


The issue is that even though I like what I'm doing, I don't feel like I've done anything start-to-finish and like I'm learning anything new -- sure I'm quickly becoming the world's largest living encyclopedia of browser and javascript quirks but lately I've been missing the sort of really stressful but incredibly satisfying high that comes from finally grok'ing lamdas or dynamic programming or the like.  

Basically, I miss school.  Not just my friends, I miss being in the trenches every day and having people who could completely empathize and working together not because we were on the same team but because it was a culture of stay competitive but help out the next person because strong competition made everyone better.  I am willing to admit I am romenticizing this a bit.

Anyways, I never got around to making any new year's resolutions, but 7 months later is better than never right?  So that's what I did -- I made a list of knowledge resolutions that I want to say I know and have experience doing and doing *well*.

My list:

- Make a new website with a blog and a project section.  
- Complete at least one small library/module/plugin/etc in javascript ([this is my inspiration](http://tholman.com/elevator.js/)).
- Do the [android nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) and build a tiny app.
- Brush up on actually implementing algorithms (DFS, djikstra's, suffix tree implementation, etc etc).
- Write about at least one technical problem or thing I learned once a week.

This list is purposely impossible.  By putting down all of the things I want to do, I'm identifying all of the parts of my big messy brain house instead of getting overwhelmed by the volume.  


Wish me luck :)
