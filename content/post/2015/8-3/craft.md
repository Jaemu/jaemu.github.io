I get restless sometimes.


Between work and a lengthy commute, I have a lot of time on my hands to do a lot of thinking while sitting still.  I think about lots of things -- work, side projects, what the hell am I doing with my life, etc. but if I'm not doing something with my hands I get perpetually distracted from my own thoughts.  


I don't think I'm alone in this.  I look around at the other commuters every morning, eyes glued to their smartphones swiping mindlessly on CandySaga, Bejeweled, or whatever flavor of the month game it is today.  None of them look happy, but whatever game they're playing has them convinced that they are not running a fool's errand, that this will be the day they beat their high score or get that new crown or what have you.  


I do the same, and yet I still feel physically restless.


I thought about this restlessness a lot because I came across [this](http://robrhinehart.com/) today.  In the article, the author eschews modern inconveniences like cooking in order to live a more efficient, sustainable lifestyle:

>I never cook. I am all for self reliance but repeating the same labor over and over for the sake of existence is the realm of 
>robots.

Robotic.  The perfect word to describe the people on the train that I watch every day of the workweek playing their games.  The last word I would use to describe the act of crafting and cooking a meal.

I remember being much younger, around 11 or 12, and watching my grandmother make [arroz con pollo](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/daisy-martinez/chicken-with-rice-arroz-con-pollo-recipe.html) from scratch.  I was following her with a pen and paper and trying to write down everything she did so that I make the same dish for a class project.  


Not once during the entire process did she ever pull our a measuring utensil.


How much chicken broth to make?  Just make a full pot's worth from the leftover chicken parts, fill the pot for the rice until the broth reaches about two inches or so on the handle of a wooden spoon.  You would think with such inexact measurements and convoluted, inefficient ways for remembering how to make different parts of the dish that inevitably some step would be forgotten or something would be ruined.


It always came out the same.
