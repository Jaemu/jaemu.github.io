<p>One of the biggest weaknesses I have is putting pen to paper, finger to keyboard, etc. without getting overwhelmed by trying to organize something that isn&rsquo;t even there.  Even in writing, my comfort zone was always editing and not content creation (I blame this background for my preference for hunting bugs and re-organizing code than architecting an application from scratch).  I think as you get more knowledge without constantly exercising that knowledge with repeated exercise this becomes incredibly common.</p>

<p>As a primarily front-end developer, this overthinking paralysis has stricken me every time I&rsquo;ve tried making a personal site.  I&rsquo;ve experimented with different blog engines, tried rolling my own, even tried just hard-coding static html pages as a thought experiment to try and identify the different pain points that were causing me to throw in the towel every time.</p>

<p>All in all, I learned several things about myself and side projects in general:</p>

<h4 id="lesson-0-you-might-not-need-javascript-insert-favorite-language-here:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Lesson 0 - You <em>might</em> not need (javascript|insert favorite language here)</h4>

<p>When I first started thinking about what I needed, I started looking into <a href="https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost">Ghost</a>, which is a full blog engine with a ton of features out of the box, 3rd-party plugins, etc.  Ghost is great and from my little time with it, seems like the kind of thing that could really fit the use case of needing a blog engine.</p>

<p>Once I started getting set up with it though, I realized that for what I wanted (a personal site to host blog posts, images, and project pages) I didn&rsquo;t really <em>need</em> a full-fledged backend and thus didn&rsquo;t really need a server to serve content.  What I really wanted was something that generated static content and could be served from something like AWS S3 or Github.</p>

<p>This was an important realization for me because one of my major problems was just identifying what it was that I wanted to build.  Even though I could run a self-hosted instance of Ghost, that required a lot of additional configuration and setup that while not <em>difficult</em> per se was an additional headache (not even going into my gun-shyness with securing a public web server after a fiasco with an EC2 instance that I was running for a network security project of all things).</p>

<p>Even though I was completely comfortable with nodejs and have been working on an incredibly dyanmic single-page application entirely in javascript, the things that nick.com need to do vs. what I wanted my site to do were wildly different in scope and complexity.</p>

<p>I learned not to overcomplicate things just for the sake of &ldquo;learning&rdquo; and to make the right thing for the right task.</p>

<h4 id="lesson-1-while-not-always-the-right-way-to-go-doing-something-the-hard-way-first-teaches-you-a-lot-about-what-you-re-trying-to-build:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Lesson 1: While not always the right way to go, doing something the hard way first teaches you a lot about what you&rsquo;re trying to build</h4>

<p>I wish I could say that I learned my lesson and continued on without making things overly complex.</p>

<p>Instead, I thought &ldquo;well I can write my <em>own</em> static site generator for nodejs!  With recursion and partials and more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As an experiment to figure out what features I would need to do so, I tried hand-rolling my own site.  In hindsight, this is like milking a cow to figure out how to make an ice cream machine but hindsight.</p>

<p>At the very least, I identified some pain points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-usable HTML templates and partials are not just a nice to have, they are a necessity.  Otherwise, woe is the developer trying to keep an ever-growing number of static files consistently pointing to the right file references, using the same class names for elements across pages, etc.</li>
<li>Writing a static HTML generator is foolhardy for several reasons, least of which is the existence of Markdown compilers.  I realized one of the biggest advantages of using Markdown is that not only is there a common language that compiles to the same elements, but it gives you the freedom to use inline HTML when absolutely necessary.<br /></li>
<li>Writing responsive CSS from scratch is a pain.  I don&rsquo;t care how long you have been doing front-end development, writing clean, maintainable, working CSS without Less/Stylus/Sass and a framework is an exercise in frustration.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>There were probably many more, but that was about as far as I got before having a conversation with my friend <a href="http://www.robxu9.com/">Rob</a> about what I was trying to do.  He suggested <a href="http://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>.</p>

<h4 id="lesson-2-done-is-better-than-perfect-or-why-you-shouldn-t-give-up-on-something-the-first-time-it-doesn-t-work-the-way-you-expect-it-to:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Lesson 2: Done is better than perfect, or why you shouldn&rsquo;t give up on something the first time it doesn&rsquo;t work the way you expect it to.</h4>

<p>Getting started with hugo was extremely easy.</p>

<pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre>

<p>Figuring out what to do from there was not as easy.  Hugo expects to create a new folder within the current directory of</p>

<pre><code>hugo new site (sitename)
</code></pre>

<p>and if that folder already exists, throws an error.  If it were me, I would have created a new site within that folder or at least created an option to pass a flag that indicates that this is what I want to do, especially when migrating content from an existing github repo that has the strict requirement of having the name (github_name).github.io.</p>

<p>Once I got past that, I stumbled on the configuration bit.  Hugo expects a config.(toml|yaml|json) file, but not all of the params are documented.  This becomes a problem when trying to add data to partials because <em>some</em> data is global in scope but others like custom params are under the .Site.Params namespace.  <a href="http://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/">This is all that I was able to find</a>, and while most of the params are documented some are given no explanation.</p>

<p>There is also some reduntant functionality.  In the config file, you can specify which theme you want to use but you can also compile your project with</p>

<pre><code>hugo -t (theme_name)
</code></pre>

<p>which is fine, but again not super well documented as to why you would want to use one and not the other.</p>

<hr />

<p>My point is, it&rsquo;s ok to struggle with a tool out of the box.  The beauty of open source is that if something doesn&rsquo;t work the way you intend it to, look at the source and if you think it&rsquo;s wrong then change it.</p>

<h4 id="lesson-3-configuration-is-important-flexible-configuration-is-a-god-send:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Lesson 3: Configuration is important.  Flexible configuration is a god-send.</h4>

<p>One of my favorite parts about hugo is the configurable folder structure.  Currently I&rsquo;m publishing to the project root directory (bad), but in the config file I can specify all of the directories I want to use and where I want hugo to publish those files.  I ran into this issue with Octopress awhile ago and found the &ldquo;use this file structure&rdquo; heavyhandedness really inflexible so this feature was a nice surprise.</p>

<h4 id="lesson-4-there-are-hackfixes-in-every-project:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Lesson 4: There are hackfixes in <em>every</em> project.</h4>

<p>When I first tried to deploy the site to github, all of my static file references were 404ing even though they were in the right directories.  I realized after a tiny bit of digging that when you run</p>

<pre><code>hugo server
</code></pre>

<p>it replaces the baseurl param with &ldquo;localhost:1313&rdquo; and puts this all over your site so that static file references work locally.  This is extremely heavyhanded (what if I don&rsquo;t have localhost in /etc/hosts and I don&rsquo;t have permissions to change that file?  Hypothetical.) for a few reasons.  I guess you could get around this by not using absolute paths to reference your static content, but that seems rather <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005079/absolute-vs-relative-urls">opinionated</a>.</p>

<h4 id="conclusions:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Conclusions</h4>

<p>I ran into a few other issues (static files not being copied over into my publish dir frrom my theme folder, customizing the theme, etc.) but all in all I found hugo easy to work with if a bit under-documented.  Most of its power comes from its tiny footprint, speed, and flexible configuration.  I don&rsquo;t mind the hard dependency on Go, but I can see that being a drawback for some (although I find Go configuration and package management much easier to manage than, say, python but I could be biased because I am using a mac with a default python installed and having to remember where python vs python2.7 vs python3 look for their packages is frustrating at best).</p>

<p>This is one person&rsquo;s experience with one tool, so please take any opinions here with a grain of salt.  However, the lessons learned here apply to any project.</p>
