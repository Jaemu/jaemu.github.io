<p>We're gonna need a reboot.</p>
<hr>
<p>It's been a minute since I updated this site. I knew it was wildly in need of some TLC, but part of me also wanted to leave it alone as a time capsule to remember the feeling of endless adventure and unknown that laid before me at what, 27?</p>
<p>Things have changed. A <em>lot</em> has changed. The short version?</p>
<ul>
<li>Divorce</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li><del>Amazon</del> Twitch</li>
<li><del>Seattle</del> Irvine, CA</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to unpack all of those things one at a time.</p>
<h4 id="divorce">Divorce.</h4>
<p>After 10 years, 2 cities, many jobs and an IPO we realized we couldn't make it work living together under the same roof.  We still care about each other, enjoy each other's company, and will probably always remain friends but as partners it just wasn't working.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, right? ðŸ¤· Maybe, most likely, probably. I thought so too which is why I stayed for a whole year trying to make it work. Maybe there was more we could have tried, but it didn't occur to me then and if I'm being honest with myself I still can't think of anything that might have fixed the root problem. I spent that whole time trying to convince myself that I was fine, that we could make it work, that I wasn't unhappy. The funny thing about the human body is that it is extremely good at giving you physical signals when you're ignoring the emotional ones. I couldn't just pretend like I suddenly trusted this person just because I wanted it to work if doing so felt like a constant threat to my well-being and livelihood which is exactly what it felt like.</p>
<p>Walking away from the relationship was probably the single hardest thing I have ever done. It sounds simple, but honestly the hardest part of all of it has very little to do with the relationship itself and more to do with my identity in the world as half of a marriage and my personal goals that had become inextricably intertwined with that identity. That whole &ldquo;no longer having clear, actionable personal goals&rdquo; thing was the single hardest thing I have had to overcome to date. Up until this point my life has been a series of clear goals I didn't need to think about - go to school, get a job, get promoted, get married, buy a house, etc.</p>
<p>If I had anything to say to anyone finding themselves in a &ldquo;can we make this work&rdquo; conflict in a relationship, it would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay grounded. Sometimes the emperor really is naked and things just are. Let go of &ldquo;should&rdquo; and learn to live with and recognize &ldquo;is&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Above all else be kind to yourself, especially when no one else will.</li>
<li>Demand respect in your relationships and not to compromise on this. Respect is a minimum, not a lofty goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more people pleasing you find yourself, the more you begin to rely on that external validation to tell you what makes you happy. If you're struggling to tell the difference, I encourage you to be willing to be unhappy for awhile, be selfish, and go piss some people off for being too &ldquo;you&rdquo;. I encourage you to separate the things that make <em>you</em> happy from the things that make you feel externally validated and to feel zero shame if and when those things happen to align. Please just make sure they align on your terms &lt;3</p>
<h4 id="cancer">Cancer</h4>
<p>I think about cancer a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>In the past decade my mom has lost two sisters and her father to b-cell cancers. Every day I get up being just a little bit closer to the age at which my mom was first diagnosed with breast cancer. During this time I was in grad school and I wanted to learn more about the nature of cancer and why it was so hard to find a cure. The more I learned about how it starts and how little we know about how cancer decides to spread in one person and lay dormant in another even when the DNA is identical (my mom's sister was an identical twin, the remaining twin has also been diagnosed with breast cancer but is in remission), the more hopeless I felt. When I had my own scare earlier this year, all of those fears from grad school came rushing back.</p>
<p>On one hand, cancer is unrelentingly unfair. It takes good people from this world with wanton abandon. At the same time, it is the world's most unrelentingly fair force of nature. Cancer doesn't care how successful or wealthy or smart or beautiful or young you are or how much you have left to contribute to society. Cancer takes good and bad people because cancer does not make value judgements. It is a bug in our DNA that is there by design and the tradeoff for cancer is that our DNA is able to mutate and give humanity a chance of surviving any threats in our environment. There's certainly unfairness in survivability based on ability to afford treatment and that is a failure of our system of laws, but at the end of the day it is a near constant reminder that we are mortal and we are one hilarious coincidence of chemicals away from excruciating pain and death.</p>
<p>This year I lost my friend Mike at 29 years old to lung cancer. I won't lie, I was angry at the world for that one for a long time. What if he had known the inherent risks of being a volunteer firefighter and increased chances of specific types of cancer due to byproducts of burning building materials? What if we had stronger laws that restricted these hazards at the cost of driving up the price of home construction and ownership? What if we made DNA testing a component of the firefighting fitness test to determine more accurate probability of attaining certain types of cancerous mutations due to frequency of DNA motifs with higher than random chance probability of those mutations occurring?</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't know that any of those data points would have changed his mind. Everything said <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/michael-dolan-iii-baldwin-obituary-1.28263523">here</a> about him is truer than anyone who never had the chance to meet him will ever know. He was humble, smart, kind, and above all else he managed to find value in every single person that he ever met. This world would be a much better place if everyone had at least one friend that made them feel valued at least once.</p>
<p>Cancer scares me but I'm not afraid. Cancer is the near-constant reminder that not all change is good, but as a species we are willing to take the chance at evolving into stronger versions of ourselves at the risk of acquiring a change that might kill us. I take comfort in knowing that it is so terrifying because there are so many people in my life that I care deeply about that am terrified to lose to something we are unable to stop. I'm scared because I know my own capacity to do good; faith that I have gifts that I can use to make this world better than I found it and that I won't be around long enough to do so.</p>
<h4 id="amazon--aws--twitch">Amazon | AWS | Twitch</h4>
<p>A mentor once gave me some really solid advice: when you're unhappy with your current situation or feel like you're not growing for whatever reason, make a change but change exactly one thing. Change one thing so that the new normal is familiar enough to allow you to thrive while being new enough to present a set of challenges.</p>
<p>I took this advice to heart and have made the decision to pursue internal transfer at Amazon whenever I felt like I could be doing my best work somewhere else. I left the video ads team after 6 months because in my heart of hearts I couldn't in good faith work on a product for which the success criteria is bothering people and preying on their insecurities and attention to make a sale. I joined Amazon Publishing because I wanted an organization with a different product mission.</p>
<p>I have no regrets about joining Apub, but in hindsight if I had taken the time to do my homework I would have realized that much of what they needed engineers for amounted to royalty payment calculation and dashboards for authors and marketing content. I thought I was the kind of SDE that could get excited over any engineering challenge, but I just couldn't make it fun for me and decided that I needed to find a team that was working on something more technically challenging and personally interesting. A year after joining I left Apub to join AWS with a team working on Amazon Sumerian where I've been for the past two years.</p>
<p>Sumerian was an interesting idea with a great premise &ndash; leverage the WebVR API and create a content publishing platform that allows customers to create XR content that can run on any XR platform. It's a javascript engine similar to babylonjs and A-frame but with custom integrations to be able to talk directly to other AWS services at runtime. I was drawn to that mission because I wanted to help build tools that allowed developers without a background in game development or computer graphics programming to be able to create content in a new medium.</p>
<p>Sumerian continues to be something that interests me but over the past two years, I found myself arguing with the product and technical direction with increasing regularity. I thought we were making a lot of decisions I disagreed with and I wasn't prepared to go in and have those battles to win. Worse, I wasn't convinced of my own correctness &ndash; if the team listened to me would Sumerian be more successful? If I couldn't be sure of that, I couldn't stay in good faith and help the team accomplish their product and engineering goals.</p>
<p>Which takes me to my current move. In a couple of weeks I will be joining Twitch as an SDE working on the Twitch Studio app. It seems hasty but this is probably the first time I'm joining a team that has transparent product objectives that I feel incredibly strongly about. Only time and runway will reveal if I'm right about that.</p>
<h4 id="seattle--irvine">Seattle | Irvine</h4>
<p>As part of the team and subsidiary change, I'm also changing cities and moving to southern California. If I'm being completely honest, I hate Seattle. It's extremely adequate as a functional place to live, but culturally there exists a coldness and immediate distrust of strangers here the likes of which I have never experienced before. I've been here for four years now, and the entire time it has felt like trying to wear a jacket that fits everyone else great but looks out of place and lumpy on you. I won't lie, I'm probably not being completely objective due to getting punched in the back of the head by a crazy homeless woman on my way to work that one time but at the time that incident just felt like the straw on the loaded camel's back.</p>
<p>Dating in Seattle has been&hellip;interesting. The coldness and immediate distrust of strangers results in quite a few first dates that feel like cold reads of rough drafts of Shakespearean monologues. The great irony of this city is that everyone is so lonely that they are desperate to seize any attention when the opportunity presents itself without any desire to engage in the dance of dialogue or repartee. I've noticed this same tendency develop in myself and I <em>hate it</em>.</p>
<p>I'm not saying Irvine is going to feel like home or that it is without its own unique challenges, but at the very least it's not a city dominated by tech for the sake of tech companies. It's a suburb sure, but honestly Seattle has felt like a very overgrown suburb that wants to attract the density of a city without any of the tools to make the city functional for its residents. Spending a week in NY really just drives that feeling home every time.</p>
<p>I'm also way more excited about getting back into surfing than I ever got over the idea of snowboarding. At the end of the day, Seattle is probably a fine city to live in for some people but it wasn't ever for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>(End of uncomfortable personal stuff)</p>
<p>I left this website untouched to remind myself of what I was like before everything that happened after leaving NY. Years later, I'm still here and still excited and hopeful about what the future holds. I think now that I'm a bit older and have gone through some shit, I'm a bit more gun-shy about jumping into those opportunities but I still believe that there's a world of incredible good out there.</p>
<p>Here's to the next chapter. Let's see if I make it home.</p>
