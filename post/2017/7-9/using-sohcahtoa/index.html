<p>I decided to split this into parts, because I had a great time at I/O and there was a lot to learn and experience over 3 days.</p>
<p><em>(Additional disclaimer: I do not present myself as a representative of Amazon nor does anything I say here confirm, deny or relate to any business strategy, priorities or initiatives currently being undertaken at Amazon.  Any mention of Amazon products are presented as my personal opinion as a technology consumer, not as an employee.  Phew.)</em></p>
<h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3>
<h5 id="pt-1---a-stranger-in-an-even-stranger-land">pt 1 - A Stranger in an Even Stranger Land</h5>
<p>In the year since I got back from I/O 2015, a lot of things have changed for me.  New job (Amazon!), new home (Seattle!), new hobbies(&hellip;yoga?), etc.<br>
A year older, not so much wiser but ultimately went into this year's conference with a different perspective than last year.</p>
<p>I left last year's I/O feeling exhausted, mildly disappointed, and hopeful for things to come but not overly inspired by any of the technology announced.  The twinge of disappointment was also partially due to a distinct feeling of disengagement.<br>
I spent so much time trying to squeeze in every last talk, party &amp; swag opportunity that I feel like I missed out on really engaging with other developers trying to make awesome things for the web.</p>
<p>I felt claustrophobic and isolated.  I was mentally engaged but I didn't feel like my heart was really in it.</p>
<p>I told myself that if I should have the opportunity to go to I/O again, that I would let go all expectations and just be gratefor for the experience.  I would stop with the obsessive planning and just soak in the experience in the moment while jotting down notes to ponder later.</p>
<p>I seriously couldn't have picked a better year to make that promise to myself.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="pt-2---a-year-of-women-techmakers">pt 2 - A Year of Women Techmakers</h5>
<p>When I got my community partner ticket for I/O in 2015, I also received an invitation to join a Slack community of other women who received community partner tickets.  I thought it was a great idea &ndash; we could find people to come sit with in talks, stand on line and blather about what might get revealed, etc.</p>
<p>To be fair, we used the Slack for exactly that purpose.  We shared info on parties happening during the conference, feedback on our favorite sessions, answered questions related to fixing our Nexus 9 tablets once we inevitably borked them with Android M developer preview, etc.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2016, I find myself on that Slack all the time.  Sometimes to catch up with people that I had met at the conference, other times just to offer my two cents on career &amp; programming questions.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, through daily communication and thoughtful content, we slowly built a really strong, connected community.  What would I/O 2016 be like after a year of engagement with technical women from around the world?  It sounds silly but I was extremely excited to see the community we spent so much effort building come together in one place a year later.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="day-0----registration">Day 0 &ndash; Registration</h3>
<p>After weeks of counting down and wishing international travelers safe flights on that same Slack, I was ready to get down to Mountain View.</p>
<p>No planning, no expectations.  Instead of desperately researching hotels and trying to get the best deal, I decided to crash with a friend nearby and wing it.  I'm a notorious overplanner and drive people nuts with itineraries, so this was a <em>big</em> step into the unknown for me.</p>
<p>My friend picked me up from the airport on his lunch break (thanks Matt!), dropped me off at Shoreline Amphitheater, and I was on my way to starting this adventure.</p>
<p>Registration went smoothly enough.  I got there around noon, took my badge photo, picked up my &ldquo;I/O Survival Kit&rdquo; containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>T-shirt</li>
<li>Carboard</li>
<li>Keynote lineup and seating instructions</li>
<li>Sunglasses</li>
<li>2 packets of sunscreen and a warning to be prepared for some sun</li>
<li>Water bottle</li>
<li>A doo-rag (?)</li>
</ul>
<p>I/O would be entirely outdoors this year, and this kit just confirmed that yes, they were going to go through with this crazy plan of forcing a bunch of shut-in developer types outside.  Game on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Fun fact: if you are an employee of Google, there is an abundance of free food, snacks, bathroom, shelter, etc.<br>
Corollary: if you are not an employee of Google and are on the Google campus, you are effectively loitering and none of the above options are available to you.</p>
<p>So yes, I effectively loitered in a large office park for several hours on a very hot day.  I had picked up my badge at noon, and my first pre-I/O party wouldn't start for another 5 hours.  No matter, this was my year of winging it, right?</p>
<p>I found a shady tree and took a nap under it, right next to one of the Google shuttle stops and right in front of the sign for 1600 Amphitheater Drive, that familiar address stamped across all of the many boxes of swag that Google would send Stony Brook's student ACM chapter for various events throughout the year.  I got some stares, started some conversations, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>After my nap, I decided to go exploring.  I grabbed one of the many bikes laying around campus, rode all the way to Starbucks and back to the visitor center, met up with some of the other Women Techmakers Slack members along the way who were also stuck on campus after registering with nowhere to go, in general just trying to take in everything around me.</p>
<p>It's amazing how much fun you can have when you're not trying too hard and appreciate the small things.  I haven't been on a bike that actually goes anywhere (sorry Flywheel, you don't count) in years and just feeling the cool breeze on my face was awesome and almost meditative.</p>
<p>At first I thought about how awesome it would be to be able to just ride bikes all over a massive campus with tons of outdoor working space right on the water.  Thinking about it more, I realized that the Amazon campus isn't totally dissimilar with the exception of being right in the heart of downtown, which actually makes it kind of awesome.  If anyone ever wants to visit, there's restaurants and cafes all around, public areas to hang out, and a few blocks away is Puget Sound.</p>
<p>I sat in Starbucks thinking about how I imagined the Google campus to be, and what I actually found which was kind of old and looked like every other generic office park.  I have no idea why, but I just had expectations in my head of what Google Mountain View would look like and what I actually found was kind of a let down and not really welcoming.  It sounds so corny, but it really made me appreciate all of the public spaces that Amazon has built around its offices and how much the buildings feel like part of the city instead of a walled garden.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="day-0----dinner">Day 0 &ndash; Dinner</h3>
<p>The night before the conference, Natalie and Women Techmakers organized a huge dinner for every single woman that would be attending I/O.<br>
<img src="/img/dinner.jpg" alt="photo credit: instagram.com/yasminemolavi" title="photo credit: instagram.com/yasminemolavi"></p>
<p><em>Photo credit: <a href="instagram.com/yasminemolavi">instagram.com/yasminemolavi</a></em></p>
<p>It was nothing short of epic.  The park was decorated beautifully, the food was amazing, and women were there from all over the world.  I met women I had only ever talked to online in person for the first time, I failed to run into others despite our best efforts, etc.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe to anyone who has never felt like an other, but to be in an environment every day working on a team where you are the only female voice and be able to have a night surrounded by hundreds of women with technology in common, it's like validation that we exist and it's normal and it sucks but we can help each other get through this and be role models for the next generation so they don't even think to question themselves if they share our passion.</p>
<p>I'm extremely lame, sitting here crying just thinking about all of the emotions I was feeling that night.  I'm not even sure that the organizers completely understand the magnitude of the impact that dinner had on many of us that night.  There was a woman who introduced herself as &ldquo;total shit at technology hoping to learn from all of the awesome women&rdquo; who got completely corrected on the spot and encouraged to stop feeding her insecurities, another who brought 3d-printed barrettes to give out just as a labor of love, and so many other stories.</p>
