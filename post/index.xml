      <description>&amp;ldquo;Are you sure you did that work? I remember things differently.&amp;rdquo;
I&#39;ve never been more sure of anything in my life.
Over the course of a lifetime, I have developed an incredibly well-defined sense of self. In a world of imposter syndrome seminars and #askformore campaigns, it can feel like this identity that I have declared my own is in some way rooted in false bravado. I prefer to think of it as the result of having lived a life running in the debugger.</description>

      <description>Dmitri PopovI decided to split this into parts, because I had a great time at I/O and there was a lot to learn and experience over 3 days.

      <description>For the next 7 days, Ryan and I are making our own version of the Oregon trail (from New York to Seattle), along with the dog and everything we own in one of these.
Peak levels of &amp;lsquo;Murica have been reached, folks.
 I have a history of making excuses based on overplayed stereotypes of salt-of-the-earth folk and cultural incest in an effort to avoid the awkward conversation about my policy of never moving to anywhere where I might be the most &amp;ldquo;ethnic&amp;rdquo; looking person in the zip code.</description>

      <title>Last Day at Viacom</title>

      <description>At the time of writing, this moment is:
  my last day with Nick digital,
  3 days before I start a cross-country adventure with my micro-family on our way to put down new roots and start the Seattle chapter of our lives,
  2 hours before my going away party starts,
  about 20 minutes before the Minibar delivery gets here.
   I started to wind down the day by writing one of those horrible &amp;ldquo;last day for ______&amp;rdquo; emails that read less like a parting note and more like a final treatise on so-and-so&#39;s insights that will motivate and steer the company towards greatness while complimenting a large number of people that person has probably never met.</description>

      <description>I get restless sometimes.
I work in the city, and thus have the distinct pleasure of a long train commute. I have lots of time on my hands to do a lot of thinking while sitting still.
I think about lots of things &amp;ndash; work, side projects, what am I doing with my life, etc. but if I&#39;m not doing something with my hands I get perpetually distracted from my own thoughts.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tree reconstruction and the phylogeny of the domestic dog pt. 1: Phylogenetic trees and edit distance</title>

      <description>I love life sciences, dogs, and algorithms so when I found this paper describing recent changes to the hypothesized phylogeny of modern dog I got giddy.
Dogs are incredibly fascinating, regardless of your opinion on breed standards and dog shows. They are the only successfully domesticated carnivore, they have the ability to understand our social communication mechanics and language, they engage in mutually beneficial social cooperation with us and we are not absolutely certain of why or when it happened.</description>

      <title>hello world</title>
      <link>http://jillmunson.com/post/2015/7-10/hello-world/</link>

      <description>I&#39;m not sure when this all began, but right now it is July 10th and about halfway through what I consider real summer and I have been plagued by this near-constant sense that I should be doing something. It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t keep myself busy, but lately I feel like none of those things require any kind of boundary pushing.
The issue is that even though I like what I&#39;m doing, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve done anything start-to-finish and like I&#39;m learning anything new.</description>
