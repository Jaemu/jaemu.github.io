 One of the biggest weaknesses I have is putting pen to paper, finger to keyboard, etc. without getting overwhelmed by trying to organize something that isn&#39;t even there. Even in writing, my comfort zone was always editing and not content creation (I blame this background for my preference for hunting bugs and re-organizing code than architecting an application from scratch). I think as you get more knowledge without constantly exercising that knowledge with repeated exercise this becomes incredibly common.</description>
