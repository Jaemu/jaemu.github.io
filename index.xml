      <title>An Introduction to LRU Caches</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When building and subsequently scaling a website, caching is important.  At the scale of hundreds of thousands of users a day, having multiple layers of caching becomes critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the job, we use the in-memory data store &lt;a href=&#34;http://redis.io/&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/a&gt; heavily (someone did a talk about it once which you can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/case-studies-2/8-ways-media-giant-viacom-uses-redis-to-serve-dynamic-video-at-scale&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  At a high level, we use it to support data coming into our sites so when we do things on the site that require lots of rapidly-changing content it&amp;rsquo;s pretty important to bust cache while making sure the site stays up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also done two technical interviews in which I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to implement a cache with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Least_recently_used&#34;&gt;least recently used&lt;/a&gt; eviction policy.  In a nutshell, LRU is a policy of dropping the &amp;ldquo;least recently used&amp;rdquo; item from cache to make room for a most recently used item that does not exist in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: Implement a cache with an LRU policy that has O(1) insertion, O(1) lookup, and O(1) removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;insertion:5fb571edf0462b9520231a3fff3fe887&#34;&gt;Insertion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve O(1) insertion, you will need to store items themselves in a hash map or a linked list.  At first, it seems obvious that this list should be ordered so a queue might suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lookup:5fb571edf0462b9520231a3fff3fe887&#34;&gt;Lookup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since lookup needs to be O(1), we need to store items in a data structure that gives us an O(1) key-value mapping.  However, we also need to be aware of the order of insertion &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; order of being looked at, which we lose if we get rid of the queue entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;removal:5fb571edf0462b9520231a3fff3fe887&#34;&gt;Removal&lt;/h4&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I love life sciences, dogs, and algorithms so when I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004016&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; describing recent changes to the hypothesized phylogeny of modern dog I got giddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs are incredibly fascinating, regardless of your opinion on breed standards and dog shows.  They are the only successfully domesticated carnivore, they have the ability to understand our social communication mechanics and language, they engage in mutually beneficial social cooperation with us and we are not absolutely certain of why or when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is there is a lot we don&amp;rsquo;t understand about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; man domesticated dogs or if man was even the catalyst for domestication.  For a long time, the prevailing theory was that dogs had evolved from wolves that were attracted to human agricultural settlements by trash.  This isn&amp;rsquo;t completely unrealistic because we know wolves are &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_anatomy#Physical_characteristics&#34;&gt;scavengers&lt;/a&gt; and that dogs have maintained some of these behaviors (any dog owner can tell you about their temporary land shark that appears around the table at mealtime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is so awesome about the findings from this study is that it demonstrates a working model of phylogeny that satisfies the current state of genetic similarity that shows dogs not as a derivative of wolf but as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mediarelations.cornell.edu/2014/01/16/dogs-and-wolves-diverged-from-common-ancestor/&#34;&gt;sibling that evolved separately from a common ancestor&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;img src=&#34;http://jillmunson.com/img/journal.pgen.1004016.g004.png&#34; alt=&#34;Neighbor-joining tree and admixture signatures from ABBA/BABA tests.

&lt;h4 id=&#34;phylogenetic-trees-introduction-and-construction-by-phenotype:0b815a1b81587847d74fa9cdce27f2fa&#34;&gt;Phylogenetic trees: introduction and construction by phenotype&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram in this picture is called a phylogenetic tree, a data structure that maintains the evolutionary relationship between child nodes.  In this representation, children on the same depth of the tree are &amp;ldquo;siblings&amp;rdquo; and their &amp;ldquo;common ancestor&amp;rdquo; is the node that corresponds to their closest common parent node.  So in this tree, BOX (boxer) and BSJ (basenji) are more closely related because they have a common ancestor that lived more recently than that of say, BOX and DNG (dingo).  Typically, the height of the tree correlates to time but I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the motivation for using base pair differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before genetic sequencing, the &amp;ldquo;distance&amp;rdquo; between sibling nodes and the placement of intermediary branching events was guessed at by similarity of observable traits, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenetics&#34;&gt;phenotype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with using the phenetic approach, most notably the existence of similar traits in unrelated species that have different evolutionary paths.  This could have occurred in isolated populations that were subject to the same selective pressures and not indicative of parent or sibling relationships in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter genomics and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance&#34;&gt;Hamming distance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;phylogenetic-trees-construction-by-edit-distance:0b815a1b81587847d74fa9cdce27f2fa&#34;&gt;Phylogenetic trees: construction by edit distance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With cheaper, faster genetic alignment and sequencing possible, we can now infer evolutionary relationships between species based on the &amp;ldquo;distance&amp;rdquo; of their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as determining the edit distance between two long strings &amp;ndash; identifying known gene regions and the migration, duplication and deletion of genes as well as rate of population growth and appearance of mutations across species &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_distance&#34;&gt;complicates this a bit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will go into more detail of the algorithms used to reconstruct phylogenic trees from genetic distance, but before you can construct a phylogenetic tree you need the data and a metric with which to measure the relative evolutionary relationships between species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the degree of &amp;ldquo;similarity&amp;rdquo; between two different species using DNA, it is necessary to sequence the current members of the species to compare and calculate their genetic difference.  In this case, siblings with a more recent common ancestor would be more genetically similar than species with an ancestor that last spread its genetic data thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the base pair representation of time.  Using base pair differences to determine similarity between species, a greater genetic distance directly correlates with a more distant common ancestor.  The program used to determine genetic distance in the study is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245873/&#34;&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;.  In the diagram above, &amp;ldquo;substitutions per 10,000 base pairs&amp;rdquo; is the number of substitutions that must be made to one species&amp;rsquo; genetic sequence to transform it into the other (in this diagram, dashed lines represent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_admixture&#34;&gt;genetic admixture&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you combine this data with known data of populations, migrations, and approximate times of divergence between two species, we can begin to pinpoint the time at which these genetic events occurred based on the relation between known divergence events and another species&amp;rsquo; genetic distance from that event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-findings-in-the-genetic-lineage-of-domestic-dogs:0b815a1b81587847d74fa9cdce27f2fa&#34;&gt;New findings in the genetic lineage of domestic dogs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this model of the phylogeny of modern dog and its relation to wolves, the study suggests that the closest living relative that produced both species occurred between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago.  If this tree is the correct model of speciation for all of the members of the canine family sampled, it makes the previously mentioned theory of dog domestication much less probable.  Other studies of dog-like fossils support the model of evolution that shows dog as having begun its divergence from its ancestor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.researchgate.net/publication/258529165_Complete_Mitochondrial_Genomes_of_Ancient_Canids_Suggest_a_European_Origin_of_Domestic_Dogs&#34;&gt;15,000 to 34,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15,000 to 34,000 years ago is before the age of agriculture, and recorded history begins.  If this is true, the domestication of dogs began during the age of men as a hunter/gatherer society.  So what does that mean for the role of humans in the domestication of dogs if the dog genome began selecting for domesticated traits before what we consider modern man existed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/science/dogs-and-humans-speculation-and-science.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which back in 2012 discussed the &amp;ldquo;speculative science&amp;rdquo; of the dog genome because there was no credible evidence to indicate that dogs played any role in modern human&amp;rsquo;s dominance over neanderthal.  While this study doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide conclusive evidence that dog and man co-evolved, it does support the idea that dogs and humans at the very least may have engaged in mutually beneficial social cooperation long before humans discovered agriculture and demonstrates pretty clearly that the ancestor to the modern dog existed during the time of neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;final-thoughts:0b815a1b81587847d74fa9cdce27f2fa&#34;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be an evolutionary biologist so don&amp;rsquo;t take my word on the quality of the science mentioned in any of the papers or articles that I cited.  I sort of fell down a rabbit hole when trying to find an article to support my dad&amp;rsquo;s assertion that he once heard on the Discovery channel that humans evolved a large visible sclera due to evolutionary advantages and the cooperative eye &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_eye_hypothesis&#34;&gt;cooperative eye hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; and that dogs also engage in social cooperation via eye communication.  Much to my surprise, my dad wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally contradicted by modern science (not a first, but a rarity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that dogs can and do signal emotions through use of visible sclera (search &amp;ldquo;whale eye&amp;rdquo; and you will get lots of images of scared or anxious dogs), there is no evidence that they engage in social cooperation with humans using eye contact.  The jury is still out on whether or not eye contact with humans makes dogs feel a stronger social bond or feel threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always try very hard to separate observable fact from gut feeling, and that&amp;rsquo;s almost impossibly hard to do when it comes to observing something you&amp;rsquo;re very attached to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it wishful thinking on my part to imagine primitive man and the ancestor of dog living and working together as a cooperative unit?  What advantage did we give ancestral dog in return that gave it such a competitive advantage over its peers?  Was it a larger shared predator or environmental pressures or something else entirely?  Did we rely on dogs to be our literal eyes and ears and over time this caused our senses to become much duller?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at my dog now snoring under my chair, curled up on an old sweater of mine, nose-first in my shoe watching her take deep whiffs of my scent which is kind of gross but also really sweet in a way.  She has lots of very strong instinctual behaviors like digging ditches to get to cool dirt, herding various family members (most of the time without us dumb monkeys figuring out that she&amp;rsquo;s sleeping soundly only because all of us are sitting on the couch), what is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=border+collie+stare&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1394&amp;amp;bih=821&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CB0QsARqFQoTCKjJm9OB48YCFc06kgodBdEP-A&amp;amp;dpr=0.9&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;border collie stare&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; when she&amp;rsquo;s waiting for me to throw her frisbee, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet even though man has molded domestic dog evolution to use its instincts to serve his needs like herding livestock and retrieving game, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give ourselves too much credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://jillmunson.com/img/puppe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meryl on selection day&#34; /&gt;

      <title>hello world</title>
      <link>http://jillmunson.com/post/2015/7-10/hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 12:57:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jillmunson.com/post/2015/7-10/hello-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when this all began, but right now it is July 10th and about halfway through what I consider real summer and I have been plagued by this near-constant sense that I should be doing something.  It&amp;rsquo;s not like I don&amp;rsquo;t keep myself busy, but lately I feel like none of those things require any kind of boundary pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that even though I like what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve done anything start-to-finish and like I&amp;rsquo;m learning anything new.  Sure I&amp;rsquo;m quickly becoming the world&amp;rsquo;s largest living encyclopedia of browser and javascript quirks but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing the sort of really stressful but incredibly satisfying high that comes from finally grok&amp;rsquo;ing lamdas or dynamic programming or the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I miss school.  Not just my friends, I miss being in the trenches every day and having people who could completely empathize and working together not because we were on the same team but because it was a culture of stay competitive but help out the next person because strong competition made everyone better.  I am willing to admit I am romenticizing this a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I never got around to making any new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, but 7 months later is better than never right?  So that&amp;rsquo;s what I did &amp;ndash; I made a list of knowledge resolutions that I want to say I know and have experience doing and doing &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a new website with a blog and a project section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete at least one small library/module/plugin/etc in javascript (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tholman.com/elevator.js/&#34;&gt;this is my inspiration&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree&#34;&gt;android nanodegree&lt;/a&gt; and build a tiny app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brush up on actually implementing algorithms (DFS, djikstra&amp;rsquo;s, suffix tree implementation, etc etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write about at least one technical problem or thing I learned once a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is purposely impossible.  By putting down all of the things I want to do, I&amp;rsquo;m identifying all of the parts of my big messy brain house instead of getting overwhelmed by the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest weaknesses I have is putting pen to paper, finger to keyboard, etc. without getting overwhelmed by trying to organize something that isn&amp;rsquo;t even there.  Even in writing, my comfort zone was always editing and not content creation (I blame this background for my preference for hunting bugs and re-organizing code than architecting an application from scratch).  I think as you get more knowledge without constantly exercising that knowledge with repeated exercise this becomes incredibly common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a primarily front-end developer, this overthinking paralysis has stricken me every time I&amp;rsquo;ve tried making a personal site.  I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with different blog engines, tried rolling my own, even tried just hard-coding static html pages as a thought experiment to try and identify the different pain points that were causing me to throw in the towel every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I learned several things about myself and side projects in general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lesson-0-you-might-not-need-javascript-insert-favorite-language-here:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Lesson 0 - You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; not need (javascript|insert favorite language here)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started thinking about what I needed, I started looking into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, which is a full blog engine with a ton of features out of the box, 3rd-party plugins, etc.  Ghost is great and from my little time with it, seems like the kind of thing that could really fit the use case of needing a blog engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I started getting set up with it though, I realized that for what I wanted (a personal site to host blog posts, images, and project pages) I didn&amp;rsquo;t really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a full-fledged backend and thus didn&amp;rsquo;t really need a server to serve content.  What I really wanted was something that generated static content and could be served from something like AWS S3 or Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an important realization for me because one of my major problems was just identifying what it was that I wanted to build.  Even though I could run a self-hosted instance of Ghost, that required a lot of additional configuration and setup that while not &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt; per se was an additional headache (not even going into my gun-shyness with securing a public web server after a fiasco with an EC2 instance that I was running for a network security project of all things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was completely comfortable with nodejs and have been working on an incredibly dyanmic single-page application entirely in javascript, the things that nick.com need to do vs. what I wanted my site to do were wildly different in scope and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned not to overcomplicate things just for the sake of &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; and to make the right thing for the right task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lesson-1-while-not-always-the-right-way-to-go-doing-something-the-hard-way-first-teaches-you-a-lot-about-what-you-re-trying-to-build:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Lesson 1: While not always the right way to go, doing something the hard way first teaches you a lot about what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to build&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say that I learned my lesson and continued on without making things overly complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I thought &amp;ldquo;well I can write my &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; static site generator for nodejs!  With recursion and partials and more!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an experiment to figure out what features I would need to do so, I tried hand-rolling my own site.  In hindsight, this is like milking a cow to figure out how to make an ice cream machine but hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, I identified some pain points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-usable HTML templates and partials are not just a nice to have, they are a necessity.  Otherwise, woe is the developer trying to keep an ever-growing number of static files consistently pointing to the right file references, using the same class names for elements across pages, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing a static HTML generator is foolhardy for several reasons, least of which is the existence of Markdown compilers.  I realized one of the biggest advantages of using Markdown is that not only is there a common language that compiles to the same elements, but it gives you the freedom to use inline HTML when absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing responsive CSS from scratch is a pain.  I don&amp;rsquo;t care how long you have been doing front-end development, writing clean, maintainable, working CSS without Less/Stylus/Sass and a framework is an exercise in frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were probably many more, but that was about as far as I got before having a conversation with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robxu9.com/&#34;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; about what I was trying to do.  He suggested &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lesson-2-done-is-better-than-perfect-or-why-you-shouldn-t-give-up-on-something-the-first-time-it-doesn-t-work-the-way-you-expect-it-to:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Lesson 2: Done is better than perfect, or why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give up on something the first time it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the way you expect it to.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with hugo was extremely easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install hugo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what to do from there was not as easy.  Hugo expects to create a new folder within the current directory of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new site (sitename)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if that folder already exists, throws an error.  If it were me, I would have created a new site within that folder or at least created an option to pass a flag that indicates that this is what I want to do, especially when migrating content from an existing github repo that has the strict requirement of having the name (github_name).github.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got past that, I stumbled on the configuration bit.  Hugo expects a config.(toml|yaml|json) file, but not all of the params are documented.  This becomes a problem when trying to add data to partials because &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; data is global in scope but others like custom params are under the .Site.Params namespace.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/&#34;&gt;This is all that I was able to find&lt;/a&gt;, and while most of the params are documented some are given no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some reduntant functionality.  In the config file, you can specify which theme you want to use but you can also compile your project with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo -t (theme_name)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is fine, but again not super well documented as to why you would want to use one and not the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to struggle with a tool out of the box.  The beauty of open source is that if something doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the way you intend it to, look at the source and if you think it&amp;rsquo;s wrong then change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lesson-3-configuration-is-important-flexible-configuration-is-a-god-send:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Lesson 3: Configuration is important.  Flexible configuration is a god-send.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts about hugo is the configurable folder structure.  Currently I&amp;rsquo;m publishing to the project root directory (bad), but in the config file I can specify all of the directories I want to use and where I want hugo to publish those files.  I ran into this issue with Octopress awhile ago and found the &amp;ldquo;use this file structure&amp;rdquo; heavyhandedness really inflexible so this feature was a nice surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lesson-4-there-are-hackfixes-in-every-project:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Lesson 4: There are hackfixes in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; project.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first tried to deploy the site to github, all of my static file references were 404ing even though they were in the right directories.  I realized after a tiny bit of digging that when you run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it replaces the baseurl param with &amp;ldquo;localhost:1313&amp;rdquo; and puts this all over your site so that static file references work locally.  This is extremely heavyhanded (what if I don&amp;rsquo;t have localhost in /etc/hosts and I don&amp;rsquo;t have permissions to change that file?  Hypothetical.) for a few reasons.  I guess you could get around this by not using absolute paths to reference your static content, but that seems rather &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005079/absolute-vs-relative-urls&#34;&gt;opinionated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusions:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into a few other issues (static files not being copied over into my publish dir frrom my theme folder, customizing the theme, etc.) but all in all I found hugo easy to work with if a bit under-documented.  Most of its power comes from its tiny footprint, speed, and flexible configuration.  I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the hard dependency on Go, but I can see that being a drawback for some (although I find Go configuration and package management much easier to manage than, say, python but I could be biased because I am using a mac with a default python installed and having to remember where python vs python2.7 vs python3 look for their packages is frustrating at best).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one person&amp;rsquo;s experience with one tool, so please take any opinions here with a grain of salt.  However, the lessons learned here apply to any project.&lt;/p&gt;
